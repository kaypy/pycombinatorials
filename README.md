# pycombinatorials

Trivial program for listing combinations of inputs

An input file consists of an integer followed by a number of lines of text

The output will be all combinations of that number of text blobs. This will be written to CSV, split across multiple files if the input is large

Really more of a 'toy' program than anything serious, but if it is useful for someone, somewhere then great
